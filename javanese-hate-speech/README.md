# A Deep Learning Approach to Abusive Language and Hate Speech Detection for the Javanese Language

## Abstract

This paper develops a deep learning approach to abusive language and hate speech detection using Javanese and Indonesian large language models (LLMs). We experiment on a Javanese Twitter dataset created by [Putri et al.](http://www.wcse.org/WCSE_2021_Spring/011.pdf), aiming to beat their best F-measure of 0.780. Using a fine-tuned Javanese GPT-2 as a feature extractor for our classifier, the model achieves an F-measure of 0.811. Surprisingly, utilizing an Indonesian GPT-2 as the feature extractor yields a superior F-measure 0.854, potentially attributable to code-mixing in Javanese Twitter data or the modelâ€™s training on colloquial language. This study further explores the nuances
of hate speech detection in Javanese, emphasizing language and model choice.
